	Great Hotel Excellent Location	Great hotel, excellent location (centrally located in New Delhi), close to Connaught Place. The hotel's interior visible through the glass lifts is adds to the excitement. The rooms are excellent, nicely done up.The only thing that needs a bit of upbringing is the bell staff, which still gives you a taste of the legacy.Would certainly recommend staying at the hotel, though is slightly over-priced.	
	I just loved the stay	I Stay there for a bussiness trip from my company.I throughly enjoyed the staying there.The service there is excellent and the hotel staffs are very helpfull. The breakfast there is complimentary.Room was a nice one with TV, comfertable bed with pillow, mood lighting and many more.	
Nov 24 2009 	WONDERFUL STAY	We stayed here last week for 4 days and had a great time. Room (standard double) was lovely - woodern floors, quality furnishings, flatscreen TV, comfy bed with pillow menu, mood lighting. Bathroom was beautiful with a huge walk-in shower. Staff very helpful and whenever you phone down to housekeeping they respond very quickly. A couple of gripes were that the mini bar was lacking in choice (just beer, champagne and soft drinks). Turn down service was always around 7 pm which was inconvenient if you are getting ready to go out for dinner. The hotel bar (Nero) was great, with a great, humidified smoking room and very attentive staff - shame it shuts at 1 am... always thought a 5 star hotel should have the bar open till the last guest had left. Monsoon the Indian restaurant was fabulous, pricy but worth it (the herb prawn starter was to die for), the Chinese on the top floor was a disappointment however. Breakfast was good - plenty of choice. Henry's bar on the top floor as another reviewer has said is just a room with drinks, not a bar, and soulless.The pool was a bit dingy - not warm enough to swim in at this time of year, and alot of it was in shadow with only a few beds. You are not allowed alcohol around the pool which is a shame when you want to have lunch and a couple of beers (nothing that sneaking beers down from your mini bar did not solve!).The spa was amazing - we had two massages, and if you are feeling romantic the couples room with private hot tub is worth the extra £25! Both massages (Indian and Swedish) were fabulous with wonderful staff and rituals.The atrium and the whole look of the hotel from the inside was fabulous - quite breathtaking. If you want to buy pashmina - there is a great shop inside the hotel that sells them from about £15 upwards, far better value than we found in Old Delhi. All in all, we were delighted with the hotel and our whole stay, and if we were to return to Delhi, we would stay at Le Meridien again.	
Nov 23 2009 	Excellent location and serivce	I have stayed at this hotelabout 3 times in last 2 years and the serivce at hotel is always great.Location is great.The only thing I would say is that when I booked this time through AAA there was extra charge for breakfast rate and when I reached hotel bkfst was complimentary.We enjoy our stay here everytime.	
Nov 15 2009 	Love the ambience	spent a quality time in delhi with my wife and I really like room hotel all environment,specially room service,pub	
Oct 19 2009 	A modern sanctuary from the chaos of New Delhi	Ranks on the higher end of Le Meridien's that I've stayed at. I was satisfied by my stay and the value and service.	
Oct 9 2009 	Top hotel with western standards.....and prices	Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in two different rooms. Clean, modern hotel with good design throughout including &quot;mood lighting&quot; in the rooms. Staff were very helpful as you would hope/expect in a hotel of this class/price. Only thing was we could not get the wi-fi to work (you needed a laptop rather than a PDA) so ended up using the expensive business centre to check email.Near Connaught Place for restaurants. There are some good bars/restaurants in the hotel but they are very pricey.We would consider staying in this hotel if we were to return to Delhi.	
Oct 8 2009 	Perfect Hotel	Le Meridien is like an oasis in New Delhi! The hotel was my favourite place in the city! Friendly staff. Very safety. We received a welcome drinks (coffee and tee) and welcome &quot;bindi&quot;. I had offer from the hotel (like a compliment) for a 3-4 hours trip in the city. i just do not like the sandal woods flavour in my wardrobe. But it is all over the India :) I prefer The One restaurant because of the not chili food :)	
Sep 27 2009 	Great hotel in Delhi	Great stay at Le Meridien in Delhi. Excelent hospitality and service. Restaurants pretty expensive.	
Sep 26 2009 	Exquisite hotel	I stayed here always when I visited New Delhi. The lobby is amazing; futuristic style.Room is great and spacious, beautiful bathroom. Well designed and modern; Exquisite.Very clean and well organized.Large flat screen tv in the room.Wi-fi available with charge.The concierge was very helpful.The hotel staff friendly.Excellent breakfast.There are some shopping arcade in the hotel. Try to visit Jaipur Gem Palace, they have nice collection of jewelry with reasonable price.It's near by Janpath street if you want to do some more shopping, walking distance.It's a great hotel.	
Sep 2 2009 	A-void!	If you like 1970s-style hotels with multi-floor atriums - or a large void in the middle, this may be hotel for you! Otherwise, I would a-void it. Sure, it is in a nice part of New Delhi, close to the key government building and several sights. However, the hotel is currently under renovation, which means jackhammers and workmen throwing stuff out windows. The power went off (and on again) multiple times while I was there. The room had no bath, only a shower with a barely-controllable nozzle. And the darkened &quot;bathroom&quot;, with mood lighting, smelt. The renovated room was decorated out in a cross between Ikea and Norwegian wood, with lots of sharp corners to bump into at night. The front desk staff were slow to serve on the way in, and looking for extras to add to the bill on the way out. The restaurant food was over-priced. I didn't try Room Service, but could see samples of their offerings still sticking to the TV remote control. The hotel's pool area was a real gathering place for hot birds - about 100 pigeons and a dozen crows I counted. The views of Delhi from the top level eatery are excellent - but in the middle of the top floor of the building the viewless Le Meridien Club is perched like a UFO, waiting to descend on unsuspecting diners eating in the atrium below. Next time, I think I will stay at the Shangri-La across the road.	
Aug 31 2009 	Best Hotel	One of the very best hotel I stayed. I was staying in a suite, the design is modern and furniture are as new. The hotel is located in the city centre area, but the room rate is surprisingly low, and staffs are nice. Other than the shower area is a bit small, you cannot pick up anything to complaint about. I took a buffet dinner on the ground floor cafe, the food is good, but it cost you US$70 per person.	
Aug 28 2009 	calm escape from the chaos	great hotel, very modern interior, spacious and airy. didnt appear to be many western visitors there. highly recommend all restaurants, particularly the chinese rest located on top floor. colonial decor but with great food and great view over delhi.down side would be lack of fast free internet acces, poor pool and sundeck area.	
Aug 21 2009 	What A Chic Place ..my 6th stay in this year	It is one of the most classy elegant trendy hotel i have ever seen during my business travel. Meridien after being taken over by starwood has done tremendous change in its approach. Spg is the winning card always thats why i started staying in this hotel. Earlier they had some work early this year but now what swanky atrium sexy bar nero aand cutest are comp stations in atrium where i sip illy and work as room gets boring if u in hotel for couple of days.Staff is amazingly helpful and take care of elderly people too as i noticed couple of girls in atrium...was touched by it.Their new Indian restaurant monsoon is one of its own as i had meal with my colleagues in there and we enjoyed. Some Indian families at entrance not very happy as children not allowed but for thats a great news as i did two lunch meetings in there.Good fitness centre amatra help me stay fat freeIts a beautiful clean stylish hotel where staff makes you feel at home if u alone. One imp thing internet is good. Would recommend business travelers definitely.Rooms is again brilliant clutter free lot of space for my things which is good	
Aug 18 2009 	Still some problems	I have staying in this hotel whenever I am in Delhi but I have experienced some irritations.#1: the hotel did not send a limo to the airport because my PA did not inform them. I would expect the hotel to ask for my flight schedule. This differentiates the best from the better.#2: Security check has been stepped up. I love this but to surrendder my swiss knife shows lack of discretion. Swiss knife is not a lethal weapon. A 200 kg man is a lethal weapon.#3: I just returned from the gym after cutting short my work out. They were BLASTING Indian Techno music even after I have requested for a lower volume. I was the only guest using it at that time.	
Aug 14 2009 	One of my favourite Hotels	Having stayed here quite a few times, i can only say that the hotel has always been a class apart.. Great service, great food, excellent rooms and a good location. What else could a traveller ask for??The hotel lobby is expansive and beautiful. Checkins are always quick and the room is always just right.. Overall a great hotel with superb facilities..	
Aug 4 2009 	Beautiful hotel in a great location; more style than substance at times	When you walk into this hotel you will greated by a visually stunning city hotel. The staff are generally helpful and attentive (though note my comment later). It is a hotel that caters well for business and leisure travellers.  The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated. We were on the 10th floor and had a great view over Delhi. We had a view of the outdoor swimming pool. I didn't use it, but it looks nice. However, there were often pigeons sitting around the edge and drinking from it!! Hence only 4 stars for 'Cleanliness'.  The breakfast is buffet-style and tasty. There is a mixture of Indian and Western dishes, both hot and cold. One thing that I found quite annoying was that the coffee they use is tasteless and instant. When I asked for proper coffee they said it would take 10 minutes and cost more. I was not bothered by the cost, but rather that this is a 5* hotel and should be doing better on something so basic. We ate dinner in one of the hotel restaurants - for a 5* hotel it was average and over-priced.  One afternoon 3 of us were having a drink in the lovely hotel cafe. We were taking a few photos of each other and were told that we weren't allowed to take photos inside the hotel! And we weren't given a reason!! The staff were almost 100% fantastic. However, there was an incident that left a sour taste in my mouth. The day before check-out I hired a private hotel car to take the 3 of us to the airport. The next morning, after we had checked-out, I went to the desk to arrange for the car to be brought round to the front. Annoying they quoted a higher price. They could not explain why and could not explain why they didn't contact me earlier. The ledger in which they write down bookings was on the desk, and next to my name the original quoted price had been crossed out and a new price written above it. I challenged them on this. The two staff spoke to each other about me in Hindi and clearly didn't realise that I understood that they were making disparaging comments about me. When I told them that I understood Hindi they looked shocked and went pretty silent! On principle, and after being treated in this manner, I refused to pay the higher price. They responded by saying that we would have to make our own way to the airport. I asked to be taken to the manager and suddenly our car was brought round to the front and we paid the price quoted the night before.  I was in two minds as to whether to recommend this hotel. However, it is a 5* hotel and so needs to be held to a higher standard then other hotels of a lower rating. Given that there are lots of great 5* hotels in Delhi, I would suggest trying them instead.	
Jul 21 2009 	In the middle of everything--and nowhere	The hotel is located right in the center of the civic district, within walking distance of Connaught Place and short rides from most of the Beaux Arts buildings. But if it is the real bustling energetic and chaotic Delhi you are after, this is probably not the place for you.The room I had was excellent--apparently recently renovated. Room service was attentive and housekeeping was diligent. In general service was courteous and competent. They provided complimentary water, which is very important for Delhi.The swimming pool, however, is not that clean, even if not many people use it. Too many pigeons and crow use it as a bird bath--and leave their stuff next to its rim.The hotel should do something about the touts next to its main gate who nag visitors to visit emporiums. The touts really make for a very frustating time--it got to a point where I exited the hotel's main gate only to enter at its other gate so as to escape a particularly eager tout.Finally, for a business hotel, Le Meridien does not provide free Internet connection! For such a pricey hotel, though admittedly its rates are not much different from its neighbors, it charges another 12 usd or so for wireless internet per day.	
Jul 20 2009 	Thoroughly enjoyable stay	I stayed in the hotel with my associates for a few days of meetings and everything went as planned. I do not have any complaints at all.The room was of a comfortable size. Perhaps the only complaint here is that the wardrobe was rather small and the bar for the hangers rather high. There were also bedroom slippers so save packing on those.I was at the Club level and the room had a shower rather than a bathtub; some of my associates had bathtubs, which I would have liked as a warm soak at the end of a hard day is very relaxing. The shower stall however had this &quot;rainstorm&quot; shower coming from the top. The water pressure was sufficiently generous to make me feel cleaned by rain. And there was also a shower hose.There were four apples of the Red Delicious variety but the food I had was good and I was not tempted to snack. There were some reviews that the apples were dessicated but not in my case.An odd incident was that I received different newspapers every day that I was there. Four days were national papers and then one day it was the IHT.The bar at the 20th floor offers a splendid view of Delhi. You'll realise how surprisingly green and low-rise it is.I would like to comment on the seeming compulsion of tip-seeking. The reason is quite simple: poverty. The Indian who is serving you as waiter or driver has a monthly salary lower than the cost of the room. I asked and apparently the worldwide average of the wage bill for a hotel is about 27-28%; in India, it is 10%. Arguably, this means that Indian worker is underpaid. But I have also heard comments that it is because they are less efficient, something that I would tend to agree with.Consider it a backhanded compliment that they hound you for tips. They think you are wealthy. Perhaps because I am Asian as opposed to Anglo I never experienced such houndings even once.	
Jul 17 2009 	Good hotel not so good service	I stayed here for three nights during a business trip and felt that the service let the hotel down.The hotel is very centrally located and the contemporary design sets it apart from other hotels in Delhi. Also the rooms are fairly spacious (but too dark!) and the facilities like the restaurants, bar and gym are really very good. However, the service was not what I would expect from a 5* hotel when paying these kinds of room rates. I had problems with my booking confirmation, changing rooms and hotel car service. Overall I was left with the impression that the convenience for staff comes before guest requirements.	
Jul 13 2009 	Fine - but where in the world are we?	This is a great place for those who want a hotel that helps them forget they are in India. Colleagues I was traveling with, for whom coming to India was a rare treat, were disappointed that there was no attempt to showcase anything Indian. So this is less a hotel for tourists than for business travelers.Thank goodness the thermostats in the rooms worked properly. The airconditioning in the rest of the hotel was so cold that my friends and I had to leave a dinner to get jackets. As someone from Southeast Asia, where you get what you pay for, I have never understood why Delhi hotels are able to charge what they do.	
Jul 3 2009 	Highly recommended	Stayed two night here while temperatures were above 42C in the city - this very much felt like an oasis. Reading previous reviews I assume that there had been some modernization in the past, and some issues, but my experience was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Decor was superb with imported italian glass tiles everywhere. Rooms were in excellent shape, large, and beautifully done. Tried all the restaurants and bars on the ground floor - Monsoon is one of the top indian restaurants in Delhi and was recommended by one of my Indian friends, the bar has an excellent selection (albeit somewhat pricy). Excellent breakfast buffet in the morning included with the room price.As previous comments, everyone did indeed expect a tip, but this is the same in any hotel. Staff was very accommodating in providing a late checkout without my even asking. Car service about 2000IRP, which is 4X a taxi, but well worth the 1 hour trip is modern air conditioned car.Only downside, morning restaurant staff seemed to act too cool and hence getting their attention somewhat of a problem. And front door staff somewhat slow in reacting to requests for a taxi if you were dressed very casually. Location was excellent for business and leisure.	
Jun 29 2009 	Was blown away with the service and product	We went there on our wedding night and stayed for a few days after. The htoel staff were lovely and friendly and happy to help in anyway possible. It was clean and beautiful. They even had Tom and Jerry playing on the TV screens on the lift and lobby :)	
Jun 21 2009 	Nice Business Get together	We conducted our Business get together for some of our esteemed clients and friends for getting our Master Card Certification. We enjoyed the hall and nice dinner buffet arrangement. Ambience was great. It was a wonderful evening. It was one of the great place to conduct Business get togethersRajJP132375165	
Jun 19 2009 	Meridien Mistake	What a disgraceful hotel - quite how they manage to claim this is a 5 Star hotel, I do not know. They should not be allowed to sport the Le Meridien brand - its an absolute disgrace.First of all, our airport pick-up failed to arrive in spite of a booking and a phone call to confirm. They still tried to charge us for it at check-out.The check-in staff were arrogant and rude and in fact so were the majority of the staff in the hotel including a lady duty manager who is rude and unhelpful. Every member of staff wants to be tipped - quite why I do not know as they do not offer any form of service. Even the room attendant waits until our return to the room trying to obtain a tip. Perhaps the hotel could pay these people more money to stop them harrassing the customers.The keycard failed to operate, so we obtained a replacement which also failed to operate. We asked the reception staff to come up with us with a keycard to open the door. The failed keycards were a regular theme during our stay and the staff blamed us for keeping them with our mobile phones rather than accepting the cards are rubbish.Everything is expensive from car hire to food yet nothing is worth the money. To add insult to injury staff then expect to be tipped! Pay the staff more Mr Le Meridien to stop them begging.Restaurant staff are slow and ineffective - they forget orders, are slow to deliver food/drinks and seem disinterested in being there. However they are still eager for their tips.Security was a joke - I would sometimes get searched, sometimes not. My wife would never get searched. Luggage did not get scanned! What a complete shambles.The room was dimly lit and would not get bright enough to get ready. The air conditioning next to useless and the floors in the room creak so loudly when you walk on them that everyone wakes up. Noise from neighbouring rooms and toilets makes you wonder if you are in a bedsit in a cheap part of town.A fruit bowl with four apples in it that are as dry as the sahara desert - how long have they been there? Come on Le Meridien - this is damaging your brand.On a positive note, the location is good for shopping and getting around. There are two fantastic hotels nearby - Shangri-La and Ramada - both of which will be an option next time we are here unlike the Le Meridien.	
Jun 17 2009	A fantastic hotel	This is a great hotel - amazing service. The restaurant on the top floor offers great views. The rooms are comfortable.	
Jun 16 2009 	Good Stay	Stayed on a business trip for one night. Was impressed by the design &amp; the bold statement the hotel makes. The service, courtesy was impeccable. Just right for a business traveller. There was some renovation work going in, the hotel left a note saying sorry with a small teddy, which was kind of nice....Did not spend much time at the hotel but it was a good stay.	
Jun 13 2009 	Enjoyed the Chinese restaurant	Good Hotel, and excellent rooms.	
Jun 10 2009 	lovely atmosphere	lovely atmosphere....lobby is great to interact with colleagues, silent music is too good	
Jun 9 2009 	best at delhi	best available hotel in delhi. located in the heart of delhi. very near to caunnut place and india gate. as per the reputation rooms are very execellent and the service are very prompt. the breakfast included in package is very tasty. love to sit in coffee shop at 24 hrs to eat something or can have a sip of beer any time. india gate is just walking distance. lot of internal changes happened since my last visit.	
Jun 8 2009 	Good Biz Hotel	this is my favorite biz hotel while in DelhiNewly renovated, big size rooms and bathrooms, good breakfast But it could do with little better housekeeping as i noticed insufficient cleanliness on my last stay	
Jun 4 2009 	Businness @ ease	Good Business Hotel. Worth statying at the hotel which will give you best facilities.	
Jun 4 2009 	Awesome	It was a great experience. The hotel could deliver more than my experience.	
May 20 2009 	Great Business Hotel + bonus in being able to walk somewhere	Stayed on business during a hectic trip. Nice location, actually able to get out and walk somewhere which is unusual for a 5* in India. Pool area disappointing though. Service etc first class	
May 14 2009 	God knows ! if renovation is over?	I stayed here while renovation or repair works of this property was going on. There was although no problem of noise or visible dirt, but most of the areas of the hotel I visited were all in a cramped and &quot;camp-like&quot; condition. Hence overall dining experience was spoilt.Printers / Xerox at business center didn't work, hence I was not billed, but I had to go to a road-side Xerox vendor in Delhi on my way to the meeting.Front-office staff is not at all courtious. Despite the fact that I was a SPG member and that I asked for a good room, I was given a room right in front of barricades made for renovation works. PREFERRED guest could have been given something better keeping in mind the loyalty they represent!120501264	
May 11 2009 	Location and Food	Location is great for Business travellers. The breakfast spread is excellent and taste is wonderful. Breakfast room gets crowded and is small for the hotel size. New club rooms are fantastic.	
May 10 2009 	A gem in the Jewel of the Crown	Le Méridien is known for its stylish hotels, and the one in Delhi is not an exception. Service was very good, from the driver who waited for me at the airport with a refreshing towel and a cold drink in the car, to the attendant serving drinks in the Royal Club, all were nice and welcoming people. The lobby is literally awesome, and very hip. Not so for the desk staff, both at check-in and check-out service was peculiarly impersonal. The room was very cool, with mood lighting and a view on the India Gate (as requested at the time of booking). Bathroom amenities are the best I've ever seen, including even band-aids, shaving kits and a toothbrush. I can recommend the spa with some hesitation: the treatment was fabulous, but the staff at the reception was not interested and even made a small error in the booking which, after I discovered it too late, took me ages to get corrected and they were wholly unapologetic for their mistake. Shame. Location is perfect, a comfortable 10-15 minute walk from the India Gate or the amazing Presidential Palace in a very green and quiet neighbourhood of this city of millions. I popped in at the Shangri-La next door for some Indian cuisine (the Meridien's Indian restaurant was being refurbished and I had to have some Indian food!). The Shangri-La is bland and the food... let's just say I've had better Indian food in Africa! In all, I'd very much like to stay at the Meridien again!	
May 10 2009 	good stay	I stayed here during one of my business trips. Its a good hotel. Good rooms. Good food. Especailly the business centre service was very prompt and helpful.	
May 10 2009 	Cheated by Hotel Management	I recently stayed at Le Meridien New Delhi and it was unequivocably the worst experience I have ever had in a 5-star hotel.1) My account was mishandled by the hotel staff resulting in my being unjustly charged around 100 USD for international phone calls that the hotel requested I make to provide them with an alternate credit card number along with copies of the front and back of the card, because the hotel's payment system was antiquated and the staff claimed that they they could not process the credit card I had previously provided them upon check-in without taking copies of the front and back of the card (a highly unsual and suspect practice, which made me even more wary as my wallet had been stolen I suspect either in or around the hotel), and this was despite the fact that the hotel had put a 250 USD hold on my card and the card was otherwise perfectly usable.2) Prior to charging the new card number, the hotel did not present me with my folio or any breakdown of charges or even provide me with the total balance. Once the staff received the faxed copy of the front and back of the new card, they proceeded to charge the card without my verification of the total charges. When I requested my folio at the front desk upon check out, I was presented with the credit card receipt showing the amount the staff had charged the new card, and I was told after my request to see my bill, that is was &quot;too late&quot;, that the card had already been charged- a fait d'accompli.I tried to dispute the charges while still at the hotel, but the staff were uncooperative in escalating the dispute to their superiors, and after numerous phone calls and emails, I still have not been credited back the aformentioned charges.3) On a more minor note, the property I also did not feel was up to 5 star standard. More specifically, despite having negotiated an equivalent price at the Oberoi and the Taj Mahal (I had previously stayed within the Taj group during my stay in India), I chose Le Meridien for my final night in India to experience a more &quot;modern&quot; 5 star hotel in the country. However, upon check-in, front desk staff failed to inform me of two important facts, that the deluxe room they gave me failed to feature a bathtub, which I would have expected in a five star property, and that the all day dining establishment was undergoing construction which caused alot of noise as it is located in the courtyard in the middle of the property around which all the rooms are situated.I would warn any potential guests from Le Meridien New Delhi, as I feel that management are not quite above board in their practices.

May 2 2009 	The place to be	Shiny glass building in the heart of Delhi is the cynosure of all hotels. A class in itself and full of luxuries.	
May 1 2009 	Great location good breakfast	The hotel is probably in one of the best locations in New Delhi.The interior is really good, great lobby and foyer.Staff is efficient.

Apr 27 2009 	Fine hotel - the best in Delhi	Managed to stay here for one night at the weekend away from work in the week,Expensive room rates but managed to get a basic room which was no more than an average hotel room in delhi.Outstanding location minutes from the centre of delhi and where the main shops area,Great interior and if you like contemporary design and italian lighting then this hotel is ideal.Did not use the pool, but looked outstanding.worth staying in for the experience.resident restuarants are fantastic and great evening entertainment and local music.	
Apr 22 2009 	Flashy Rooms	Its right in the heart of delhi. They have very well designed rooms with excellent view. The service is fantastic. You get spoilt like a maharaja. The food is good and they have a lovely night club.	
Apr 19 2009 	Class Interiors	Loved the ambience and the interiors of this place. Unlike any other 5 star Hotel property in India.You may feel your not in India here. The upholstery, seating etc in the lounge, banquets waiting area is plushRooms are nice, though no bath tub in the loo was alet down (rm. no. 927 on non-smoking floor).Service is excellent.Food is nice. Menu in Room service is much wider than other Le Meridien properties in India.OVERALL NICE EXPERIENCE	
Apr 17 2009 	Decent ... could be better	Excellent location! Has great facilities but could be packaged better. Services need improvement.	
Apr 16 2009 	Great stay right in the heart of Delhi....	since i live in delhi i rarely get the chance to stay in a hotel in the same city but last month i checked into the le méridien new delhi for one night for a conference....the hotel is located very close to the center of the city &amp; has a number of shops &amp; restaurants nearby....the stay exceeded my expectations at every point....being platinum status with spg really helped as they upgraded me to a great suite on the spg floor &amp; also offered me free breakfast at the lounge....i had dinner at the coffee shop which had a great buffet spread....there was a little bit of work going on at the hotel but it did not seem to either get in the way or disturb any of the guests....all in all it was a great experience....i have driven by this hotel a number of times &amp; never really thought of it as one of the better hotels in delhi....i now have a different opinion....	
Mar 31 2009 	Very nice hotel much better than the trip adivsor rating	Recently spent two nights at the Le Meridien New Delhi and thought it was fantastic They are still renovating the hotel but I can do without a few over priced shops. The rooms were very nice and new we stayed on the 12th floor which was quite a nice view over the india gate and the street below. The hotel food is nice but expensive, breakfast is okay. The hotel is a little bit removed from the action but still extremely close to everything. All in all a great place to stay. Even the currency exchange was at a rate better than that available at the airport. Highly recommended	
Mar 29 2009 	Not bad but not great	Stayed two nights in Febuary 09, upgraded to executive floor. Hotel was okay but I felt rooms were small and bathroom was tight when we were both in it. Moodlighting was fun. Exec lounge was very good with good selection at breakfast and afternoon tea. All staff were very attentive except pool and gym staff. Pool not available as being repaired, outside patio area was covered in pigeon s... Good central location.	
Mar 20 2009 	Fine Business traveller place under acceptable conditions	I stayed in the Le Meridien for three days on my annual business trip to India last week. My rep booked the place and which first struck me was the pricing. Last year 4-5 Star Delhi hotels costed around 200-300 EUROs a night. Now I payed 5500 INR which totals 81 EUROs a night including breakfast. This was really a good deal!!1. ARRIVAL AT INDIRA GHANDI INTERNATIONAL:I asked my rep to arrange pickup by the hotel. The Sadar driver waited at the exit for me and took care of my luggage. He wanted me to change some money (while he could watch over my shoulder and see what I will be changing and calculate the amount of his tip). As I am annually travelling to India since almost 15 years I declined his offer to lead me to the Thomas Cook booth and I told him that I brought Rupees with me already. Then the story of his &quot;two poor Children&quot; came up and I told him that I am not caring at all and advised him to drive me to the hotel as quickly as possible and upon the arrival I would decide about his tip. He stayed quiet and did what I asked him to do. Upon the arrival I gave him 50 Rupees. It is defintely not advisable to give more tip in India. 2. ARRIVAL AT THE LE MERIDIENThe arrival is similar to security check at an airport 20 years ago. My luggage was brought into the lobby and I had to pass a metal detector and was handsearched afterwards. My handluggage was also searched. When I passed the security area (makes sense after 11/26 incidents in Mumbai) I walked into a boutique style lobby which was fairly empty that late at night.3. CHECKIN:As a Starwood Preferred Guest I was given a room on the 12th floor which is their &quot;Starwood Preferred Guest Floor&quot;. The checkin was fast and efficient, the luggage was brought to my room within three minutes after I closed the door of my room.4. THE ROOM:Looked recently renovated, the light coloured wooden decor may not be of everyones taste, the &quot;mood light&quot; behind the bed as well-but they at least tried to do a bit different from the wannabe colonial style in other Delhi hotels such as the Taj Mansing, the Park etc. TV was a 46 inch plasma with tons of channels. The mini bar was well filled and relatively cheap (approx. 1,20 EURO for a soda), Room service worked well but seemed to be easily disappointed about Indian-style tipping from a European. The room was very clean and big enough for two. The lighting in the bath was a bit dark but also pretty well designed and everything was in good shape and working order. Loved the rain-shower.... The control panel for all the lights, alarm and A/C (not necessary last week with temperatures around 25 degrees outside) is a bit confusing but works pretty well if one understands how it works. All over all a very good experience. In room safe and all the little 4-5 star hotel gadgets were in the room and made the stay very nice. 2 Newspapers a day, a printout of a German newspaper`s front page, fresh fruit and bottled water were complementary every day. I had a direct view from my room to India Gate and the Red Fort.5. BREAKFAST:Breakfast was complementary and complete. A cooking station provided fresh eggs, omlettes etc. (plan a bit waiting time), juices and fruits were fresh, the choice of continental/English breakfast from the buffet war rich. Be aware: They`ll seat you the french breakfast style - you will be sitting on a long large table with strangers opposite and next to you if you come alone to the breakfast room. Nothing unusual if you have travelled to France.... FAZIT:Positve:- excellent value- well equipped, maintained room- clean and safe place- good breakfast- excellent location (right within Government district, close to Connought)Negative:- still some construction going on (bar &amp; cafeteria is being built)- some greedy staffI will definitely come again next year.	
Mar 10 2009 	Best Hotel in Delhi	The best hotel ever! Amazing breakfast buffet, amazing indian restaurant on the 2nd floor. Service, staff, decor was top class. This is the only hotel I would stay at when i return to Delhi. Highly recommend it!	
Mar 7 2009	An Oasis for Tired Travelers	This was our first stop on a &quot;Heart of India&quot; tour (14 people). Arriving at 6 am --after delayed flights and a harrowing ride --the first of many-- from the airport, we were so pleased to have a clean bed and hot water. Le Meridien was far more.The staff, except for a &quot;lady&quot; in the business center, who was so rude I seriously thought of complainig to the front desk, was most accommodating --our &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign that first morning was honored.The room was spotless; the breakfast outstanding.The hotel did not have great charm, but it did have a bonus. We were there during &quot;marriage season,&quot; and we could see the fireworks displays throughout the city.	
Feb 26 2009 	Disappointed	My husband and I stayed here at the end of our 3 week trip to India. Most of the lobby area was under construction, and was noisy until 9pm. We couldn't access the shopping arcade. We had to switch rooms late at night, and the information wasn't communicated to the day staff the next day, requiring several conversations with different people.While the front desk staff was friendly, they were unhelpful with suggestions/directions to major tourist locations. There was always a backup of cars entering the hotel. It was definitely geared to the business traveler. While it was centrally located, would check out other hotels on our next visit.	
Feb 22 2009 	nice hotel good standard	building and rooms are nice. gym is good, outdoor pool is a disgrace and a health hazard (dozens of pigeons all over).staff is generally helpful. food ok. all in all a good option in Delhi but not quite international 5 star.Once one is accustomed to Delhi hotel prices, the rates are acceptable. worth bargaining hard.	
Jan 8 2009 	Fine business hotel	The hotel is perfectly fine. Nothing special (except the service was very good). Rooms were clean and everything functioned properly. Restaurants were good. Gym and pool were fine. It just doesn't have much soul or character. Fine for business, but if you're looking for a taste of India, it doesn't have much.	
Nov 9 2008 	Bon Jour Meriden	well to start with the best thing about the property is the location itself. Its located right right in the heart of New Delhi, amidst a lot of greenery as well as the proximity to almost all of Delhi's tourist hot spots. Well connected to the airport as well as the railway station. Once you get into the hotel you fell this out of the world experience as you step into the pristine white lobby. The highly courteous staff, excellent rooms at very reasonable price and the highly recommendable Indian Specialty restaurant PAKWAN, are few of the high points of this ultra luxurious 5 star deluxe property	
Oct 30 2008 	OK to arrive at business services a rip off	I wanted to get a nice room to relax in and assimilate for my first trip to India. I had some business meetings in New Delhi and my daughter is going to university for a semester so it was great to visit. The first of several upsales at the hotel was to get an extra room key from the front desk. We explained she had a home in Delhi but apparently that didn't suffice. The room was nice. The hotel is within walking distance to landmarks such as India Gate and the national museum. Metro system is easily accessible as well. Food at the first level buffet was good and affordable. Great place for a morning coffee. We ate at the Chinese restaurant at the top of the hotel and it was nothing to get excited about other than being convenient to the room. The hotel was doing some renovations but they were efficient and clean. The Spa experience was disrupted by some drilling but life goes on.I had the Indian Spa experience. I was after a simple stress reduction massage. After a reservation discussion, I agreed to a 60 minute massage. The Spa called my room to see if I could arrive 30 minutes earlier. Considering that I had made the reservation 8 hours earlier it was mildly annoying. When I checked in at the Spa, the earnest female clerk insisted that I really needed a 90 minute massage. I insisted that the 60 minutes would be just fine. After much discussion behind the counter I was asked to meet with the &quot;doctor.&quot; I was met by the doctor who prescribed both inter and external problems with me and 90 minutes was necessary for my apparent issues. I was amused and agreed by signing several releases to 90 minutes, after all, he is a doctor.I actually loved the 30 minute leg reflexology delivered by a remarkably talented Chinese masseuse. You are never touched above the knee and it was fantastic. I awoke absolutely refreshed. Amazing. The synchronized massage which involves two people was interesting but I won't be doing that again. Probably a personal preference of mine and not a reflection of the oils, talent or handling by the masseuse pair.The worst annoyance was printing 10 pages from a thumb drive for a presentation in the business center, one page was blank. It cost me about 23.00 dollars American and was a total rip-off. It was handled by a woman who could have been in Vogue magazine. She was unable to provide me with a receipt and I was in a hurry. I think she was the Doctors wife.	
Oct 6 2008 	Great Hotel! Service is where they excel!	Stayed at the LeMeridian in Delhi for 2 weeks on business in May. Was an excellent stay -- many nice touches you would expect from a 5 Star Hotel.Airport TransfersHotel arranged pickup. I was met by a concierge at the airport who helped me find my car, where cold towels and bottled water were waiting. Courteous driver, pointed out the sites along the way and made a few suggestions for things I might want to see during my tripFront desk/ServiceSmooth, efficient and friendly each time I interacted with them. Each person I met on the staff was friendly, greeted you, and smiled. I felt very welcome by everyone!RoomsThere are two color schemes in rooms --- one dark, one light. Some people have issues with the dark room, but I liked it. Beds were very comfortable, bathrooms were large and functional, lighting was good. Room was serviced at least twice a day -- bottled water was restocked each time. Most evenings, I received a cheese or desert plate when my room was serviced. Over each weekend, I was given a new book as a gift. Had the hotel do laundry at one point -- no issues and very prompt service. Internet connection worked wonderfully and the switchboard had no issues with the calls I got at all hours of the night from the US.Breakfast/LoungeIncluded in the rate -- either in the executive lounge or the main restaurant. Both were nice depending on your mood --- there were more options in the main restaurant, but quieter in the lounge. The lounge still had an omelet station. Food was excellent in all cases. The lounge also had happy hour snacks and offered a different veg / non-veg option each day.RestaurantsThe main restaurant had great food --- the pastas could not be beat. Most everything on their menu was also available by room service. The Indian Restaurant on the top floor was also excellent with great views.Concierge / Travel DeskThis was the one area that disappointed me --- I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted, and didn't get many suggestions. It seemed the staff was hesitant to help me.Shops Lots of options in the hotel iteself at many price points and all willing to bargain. I found the best options and service in jewelry from Manoj at Padma Gems (I forget which, but either suite 13 or 14). He even did a custom pendant for me!	
Oct 6 2008 	Typical Le Meridien...	We spent our Eid holidays in India and flew into Delhi from Dubai to commence our Golden Triangle tour. The exterior of the Le Meridien Hotel was quite dated but the interior was reasonably renovated. The lobby and rooms resemble the Le Meridien style, but since it is an old building many parts including the upper floor restaurants are tired looking.Check-in and check-out was slow and service level was generally poor, but after staying in other 5-star hotels in Jaipur and Agra I guess it's best to simply lower your expectations. A few incidents that annoyed me include:a. I was specifically asked my check-out time during check-in but received a subsequent call during my nap to ask exactly the same question;b. I called to arrange for a wake-up call at 6:15am and they called back 5 mins later confirming that it's 5:45am;c. No complimentary water in the room (again typical Le Meridien);d. At check-out, the front desk staff handed me my bill in an envelop without looking at me or saying &quot;Thank you for staying with us etc&quot;. I thought that was extremely rude.On the plus side, the room was very clean and comfortable. Also the food quality was great. We tried 2 restaurants and room service and were content with the standard.Location of the hotel is also an advantage as it is very close to the central attractions.Overall quite a decent accommodation.	
Aug 8 2008 	great hotel	This was my 5th stay at the hotel, and I enjoyed this stay as much as the previous times.I was picked up at the airport, my room rate included airport transfers. I was offered cold towel as well as bottled water.Check in was smooth at the Starwood Preffered Guest desk (I am a gold member).The room was on the 16th floor, with a nice view of India Gate.The room itself was nice with a 42&quot; plasma screen, desk, armchair and complimentary water as well as a bottle of wine (decent as well!)They are revamping the lobby floor at the moment, the Brasserie will be modernised as well as the Eau bar. I was told it will be finished in a few weeks.The Indian restaurant on the 1st floor is excellent, I asked the waitress to suggest some local indian dishes and it was fantastic.Service is top notch at this hotel. The price in August is correct, but it can get ridiculously expensive in high season. But this is a common trend in India these days.	
Jul 25 2008 	Nice but spend extra money for The Imperial	After two largely unsuccessful Delhi stays, I decided to spend my third stay at five-star hotels. I sprang for The Imperial the first night, and used my credit card rewards to get the Meridien room the second night. This is a nice hotel, my room was modern and clean, had a large TV and cool lights, bathroom fixtures, etc. The shower was excellent, and had hot water whenever I tried it. I ordered a mediocre cheeseburger (beef, finally!) from room service for lunch and went to their bistro restaurant for dinner, where I had an excellent roghan josh and a cocktail, all reasonably priced. The minibar was fairly cheap, so I sprang for a few things. For some reason, they gave me a complimentary bottle of wine with the room, which I found more than quaffable. The bed was comfortable, and I slept well. Both the alarm and a wake up call woke me up as planned in the morning. Their workout room is small, but I was able to get a treadmill run in. The bad: checkout took 15 minutes for some reason, despite my being in a hurry to catch my flight. This is unacceptable at such an expensive hotel. Indeed, check-in took some time, I stood directly in front of the desk for 3-4 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me, which was irritating. The restaurant options are unimpressive, they're adequate, but I was expecting more from a 5-star hotel. Finally, while I had an enjoyable stay, this hotel really is astonishingly pricey for what you get... a pretty ordinary room that would be perhaps $120 in the US. You're unlikely to be unhappy with your stay, but I recommend paying the extra $50 and staying at The Imperial or Orberoi; you will see where the extra money goes.	
Jul 18 2008	awsome service	hii stayed at Le Meridien New Delhi,The service was amazing the rooms were so luxurious and comfortable.receptionsist Ms Chandni was so helpful great empathy lovely place to be with famiy.will visit again	
Jun 9 2008 	Loved the bedroom	I had one night to spend in Delhi before making a flight back to London and fancied some luxury. I thought the room was very impressive and I felt nice and relaxed here which is just what I needed. Loved the different colour schemes you could select the lights to change to. Bathroom was all mosaic tiled. Would definitely return to this hotel if I was in Delhi again and was splashing out on a 5*	
Apr 29 2008 	Classy Contempory!! Slept Well	It was great experience after long flight, good airport welcome and convinient drive to hotel. Very classy good room size and comfortable bed. It was my sheer luck that Olympic torch was at this hotel..felt great and proud to see it. Cause of extra security there were little restrictions but every where saw Olympic environment. I am a sports lover so enjoyed. Got choice of pillow which was exceptionally good and interesting so had sound sleep both the days.Room service was good but chinese restaurant was not operational.Would feel its grreat value for money..will stay again	
Apr 23 2008 	Shangri-La next door is much better!	Mostly a business hotel--looks like an old-style Embassy Suites. (you know--atrium style with walkways around to the rooms). It's quite intimidating if you're afraid of heights. The hotel interior is very dark. The gym is small, poorly equipped. But it is supposedly temporary. However, it's also not open when most business travelers can use it. (7:00 am - 8:00 pm during my stay).The room itself is bright enough, and clean. No bathtub, shower only. Mediocre food, mediocre service, no decent fitness facility--all of this for a mere $450 per night.	
Feb 20 2008 	A Hotel without a Soul	I booked my room through spg.com as a Gold member. Room charges across all level are sky high these days as it is being peak season in Delhi. Since, I booked a club room airport transfers both ways were. A driver with my name on paging board was waiting at airport on arrival hence the start was good. At the hotel, the lobby was like a huge hall at extreme end of which was the reception desk. To my mind not a very nice design. At reception, I was greeted by a staff called Mayank who asked me if I was tired. As I had a long flight with transfer connection in between I said yes I was. Once I finished check-in formaility the staff concerned said that rooms were occupied as it was early morning and I would have to wait for a few hours. However, he would offer a room if I agreed to pay previous night room charges. And it was around 7am in the morning! Although I requested for early check-in when I made the booking but the staff at reception refused to budge showing the policy of the hotel. When I asked if I could go up to the Club lounge and wait he said it would not be possible until I was allocated a room. After an hour long wait in the lobby when I finally got into my room #1215 I was greeted with strong smell of tobacco smoke although I requested for non-smoking room. Immediately I called the front desk and reported my displeasure and insisted in a room change. But the answer was a flat 'no'. The explanation was that the rooms had wooden flooring hence all rooms had smoking facility. I just could not believe my ears. When most of the reputable hotels worldwide are switching to 'no smoking' policy here is one which has turned into 'full smoking'. As it was a short stay for just one night I would not make further comments about room decor, mood lighting (did not live up to my taste), bathroom (without a bathtub), room service, lounge service, etc. In one word they were all very mediocre. Delhi has some excellent hotels, like, Taj Mahal, Oberoi, Taj Palace, to name a few, this one should be placed right at the bottyom of the list of 5 star hotels in the Indian capital.	
Feb 11 2008 	Good Business Hotel	This hotel is part of the Starwood chain of hotels. It is a clean, modern hotel right in the centre of Delhi within walking distance of India Gate, the Indian Government Complex and Connaught Place. The rooms are modern , spaceous, clean and well equipped. There are 20 floors and all look down on an inner court yard. Don't have a room on the top floors if you are afraid of hights The look over the rails into the courtyard is frightening!As an aside, don't call the Starwood 1-800 number if you want to arrange a pick up from the airport. The operator asked me which country Delhi was in and recommended to pick up a phone at the airport upn arrival. Now, if you have ever been to Indira Ghandi International, you know that there is no phone. Phone the hotel and arrange for the pick up and they send a driver, and it's free.	
Feb 9 2008	Mediocre Meridien	Outrageously expensive and mediocre in process.How easy it is in business to make ammends - but only if everyone in your team is empowered to do so. Le Meridien staff are there to look after the interests of the hotel first, and the guests only where they fit within the rules.A poor result from the start, and not getting better.- Car booked for airport - but not on the list. One was organised in due course, but an ominous start.- Smoky room with two beds. Switched to non-smoky room with two beds.- Phenomenally noisy - street noise and neighbouring room noise - TV, Kids. Room itself is noisy.- Broadband is really a trickle - less than dial-up speeds at 4:00 AM- No end of stairs - constantly going up and down. Lifts don't seem to go where you want them to.- On a positive note, the Indian Restaurant was fabulous - though the waiter ensured we ordered far far more than we could eat.We're due to come back to Delhi in December - but not to this hotel.	
Jan 29 2008	Good hotel but not without problems	The reviews of this hotel are pretty polarised. Most people either love it or hate it. I stayed there with my partenr for 4 nights over New Year and my opinions were a bit more mixed.Firstly the building is impressive if you like the atrium type of design. The location is a bit deceptive. It is actually only about 15 minutes walk as the crow flies to Connaught Place but there are some tricky road crossings and roundabouts to negotiate, particularly during rush hour. Plus a lot of extremely persistent rickshaw drivers, beggars and touts directly outside the hotel.The first problem however arose when checking in. I booked through expedia at a rate of 7877 rupees a night but when I checked in the girl said the room charge would be 9000 rupees a night, citing the usual scam about my rate not including taxes (even though my reservation printout clearly stated that taxes were included) As it was 2 o'clock in the morning I couldn't be bothered to argue and to their credit when I checked out I was charged the exact rate I had been quoted with expedia.Having stayed in Delhi before and knowing the traffic noise I asked for a room as high up as possible. We were given a club room on the 16th floor but the same person neglected to tell us we had been gicen a club room so we were not able to take advantage of the club privelages.The club rooms are spacious and tastefully furnished (the mood lighting will not be to everyones taste though). The bathroom was also great.The service and food and drink standards were excellent. Most of the negative points apply to expensive hotels just about anywhere but particularly India.Firstly you feel a bit like a cash dispenser, dealing out tips right, left and centre for the smallest of services, many of them unsolicited or even un wanted. Even though we were out alll day the housekeeping guy insisted on waiting until we got back to our room before he came to the room to replenish the soap in the bathroom etc - in a ridiculously transparent attempt to solicit a tip. This sort of stuff is annoying in the extreme.Other gripes. Even though it is winter the daytime temperature in Delhi was about 23 deg C. After the madness of Delhi it would have been nice to sit in the sun and take a drink on the terrcae. However the location of the pool means that the terrace is almost constantly in the shade and the pool is little more than a pigeon toilet.Another problem is that the hotel doesn't have a proper bar. A real bar is the life and soul of a decent hotel. Le Meridien has a room on the top floor which they call Henri's bar but it is not really a bar - it is just a room where they serve drinks. The place on the ground floor of the atrium where the bar should be in any hotel with self respect sells ....... cakes.This points up the major problem with this hotel.It does not seem to care much about its residents. It is much more interested selling expensive dinners and shows to rich Delhites than catering to the needs of its residents. This was illustrated clearly on New Years Eve. As we were flying to Kerala early on New Years Day we had planned to have a quiet meal and a few drinks. However EVERY restaurant in the hotel had some special NY function with a cover charge of 2500 to 8000 rupees a head, and all except the brasserie were fully booked anyway. The excuse for a bar was closed completely as it was rented out for a private function so we spent New Years Eve watching King Kong in our rooms with some very expensive room service.	
Jan 29 2008	Worst Hotel Ever	Even for India, this hotel was disgraceful. Throughout my trip I stayed in pretty much all levels of hotels because of availability in the locations visited, so I experienced some pretty basic accommodations. Nothing was as bad as this hotel -- especially given the cost and the purported 5 star rating.The rooms were small and dark. The lights were controllable from a small bedside console with no instructions. The lights could not be made bright enough to actually see in the rooms unless the shades were open in broad daylight. Putting on makeup was impossible. On the flip side,there was a hardwired permanent night light in the bathroom and on the floorboard of the room. Even the engineer sent by the hotel after complaint was unable to disable this. It was too bright to sleep. The thermostat in the room could not be adjusted despite the appearance of dials and controls. The room was freezing and management offered a space heater as a solution. They admitted that the guests were unable ot adjust the temperature of rooms -- only fan speed.The automated wake up call service did not work. The desk offered me a wake up call and complementary am coffee to smooth over my dissatisfaction at being unable to sleep. The wake up call never came. The coffee -- cold -- arrived about 10 minutes late with a knock on the door. Then it appeared on my bill and a major conference with the Hotel manager was necessary to remove it from the bill. The key was deactivated at least 5 times in a 24 hour stay. Each time i was told it was because of being in the same pocket with my cellphone (it wasn't). This experience was duplicated by all 25+ people in my travellng party -- as was the room lights and air conditioning situation.There are more complaints i could list. This hotel is very expensive and no better than a Motel 6. It is decorated in garish ersatz boutique hotel style. At the elevators at every floor there is a giant tv running continuous loops of Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons.I never write reviews but this atrocity deserves to be revealed. Especially since the cheapest room starts at $450/night.	
Jan 26 2008 	Best Deal in India	I stayed at Le Meridien Delhi for two nights in December 2007. This place was first rate from the get go. I used the hotel airport transfer service which cost about $30 (US). I was greeted at the International terminal without any trouble even though my flight was 2 hours late. The driver was dressed all in white with white gloves. He took my luggage and led me to the hotel car which was a Toyota Camry (very nice by Indian standards). He gave me an ice cold bottled water and wet towel to wipe my face and hands. After a 15 hour oflight, this was so worth the $30. The hotel is very modern. My guess is that it was completely redone relatively recently. I booked directly through starwood's spg site. I was upgraded to a club level room for no extra charge which included a private lounge which served breakfast every day and drinks and appetizers in the evenings. Also had two computer terminals fr free use. The room was all wood (walls, floors) but very modern. Plasma tv, control panel for everything (a/c, tv, lights, etc) right next to the bed. Bathroom was finished with mosaic tile and high end fixtures. Best feature of all were the slippers which were the nicest hotel slippers I have ever received. The service was great. All staff greeted me by name. No problems at all. The best part was that I got all of this for $206 (US). In Delhi, that's a steal.	
Jan 7 2008 	Never again... awful!	I am a regular traveller to India so I've re-set my standards very low and typically go to Indian hotels expecting to be mis-treated, abused, overcharged, etc. I must congratulate the Le Meridien Delhi for finding several new and interesting ways to upset a guest... and to make sure they never return. Check in was slow but not interminable. Credit to the young lady who checked me in, she did have a decent attitude. Room was dark and quite small. This is an atrium style hotel so there is noise in the room both from the street and from the atrium.Food in the hotel was lousy. Fish in the top floor restaurant left me with a 3 day case of Delhi Belly. The gym was small with one off-brand elliptical machine, one old stairclimber, one bicycle, and 3 treadmills, of which only one seemed to function. Gym normally opens at 7 or 8 so I asked for it to be opened at 5 which is my normal exercise time, but I failed to ask for it to be open, with the power turned on, with the air-con on, and with the remote available for the TV, so on successive days at least 2 of these were not available and no-one in the hotel seemed to understand!The new and interesting event was that one night at 2:30 in the morning my doorbell rang... and rang again... and again. I kept checking, but noone was there! Soon it was ringing nearly constantly It took about 30 minutes for the hotel to respond to my calls and finally they fixed it by just disconnecting it, saying it must be a short in the wire! If this is how poorly the hotel is wired, what fire hazards also exist?Through all of this there was no apology, no acknowledgement, and when I asked upon check-out to speak with the hotel GM, the staff refused to pass along his name, email address, nor contact details. Bottom line is that for $445 you can find something in Delhi that will only upset you in the customary ways that anyone who travels frequently in India is now used to... no need for all of these new annoyances!	
Dec 19 2007 	5* looks no stars for service	I'll start by saying that we were going to start our honeymoon in this hotel - but to finish it here was the worst possible way to end the holiday of a lifetime. Thank God we stayed in The Claridges instead for the first couple of nights.The service is abysmal in the restaurant and at the front desk. In the La Brasserie, my wife and I got fed up with the looks of disdain and the nonchalant attitude towards the service we were given. Emphasis was definitely on clearing the table as quickly as possible. We were even greeted by the duty manager with a stare until he forced a hello out of us - but we got nothing back!The rooms and the hotel itself were amazing and the service provided by the bar staff and the room attendants was typically Indian in terms of courtesy - absolutely wonderful. We were going to forgive the hotel the idiots who work in the restaurant (although that in the Pakwan restaurant was pretty decent but a little on the cold side) until we checked out. Notwithstanding the fact that the idiot on reception seemed to be put out by our wanting to check out and the complete absence of any eye contact or courtesy, as we were getting more and more irate by his behaviour, a representative from the hotel asked us to complete a feedback form. When my wife explained to her that we were in a rush and had our travel agent representative waiting to escort us back to the airport, she slapped the form down on the desk and repeated her request, which by this stage was more of an order. All of this was witnessed by the rep, who himself was gobsmacked and mentioned that his very reputable international company were looking at their arrangement with Le Meridien.The door staff were amazingly polite to us on our way out but we were so p-ed off with the idiotic members of staff we had endured that we just wanted to get out of there as soon as we could.You may find that you like the service but I promise you it is not in the same league as The Claridges in New Delhi nor any other hotel run by an Indian company (Taj, Oberoi, etc.). Oh, and one more thing - in spite of having very nice polite and friendly staff, the outdoor swimming pool is a glorified pigeon bath caked in pigeon poo - no joke!	
Dec 6 2007 	Great service!	Just accompanied my husband on a business trip to Delhi-this was my first time in India and I didn't have too much information on what to expect, but I must say that the level of service received in this hotel made my trip very enjoyable.I was struck by the high quality of customer service here-everyone bent over backwards to make sure we had everything we needed.We also had dinner one night in the Pakwan restaurant which was delicious.I would recommend this hotel to anyone.	
Nov 7 2007 	5 Star all the way	Both myself and mywife stayed here at the end of September for 2 nights.Check in was efficient and friendly.The room, (a suite) was fantastic, with the attention to detail evident.The service was second to none, including all the restaurants, toliets, room service and club lounge.The location is also very central, merely a ten minute walk to Connaught Place.Couldn't fault the place - highly recommended, (but not cheap!!)	
Sep 14 2007	Loved Delhi Le Meridien	We don't know what everyone is complaining about. We're Americans, and this was our first stay in India. This was an awesome hotel! Everything was great - the food, breakfast, the rooms - even the shops were cool. Service was excellent. The bath was very nice - I only wish I had that setup in my place at home. Would DEFINITELY stay again - above average, bordering on excellent.	
Sep 3 2007 	Not worth the Five star status!	I had heard many good things about Le Meridian from some family members, so I decided to book it. The rate I got was very good, and it was via Expedia.com. Checking into the hotel wasnt a problem. Our luggage was promptly brought up by the bellman, and the front desk check in went fine. The Lobby of the hotel is very spacious and nicely decorated.The room had ample space, had wood floors, a nice size bathroom with mosaic tiles on the walls and floors, a large plasma/LCD television, and a nice view of the city. Seemed very good! The first problem that arised was that first night. The power went off about 2-3 times for about 5 minutes each time, leaving us in total darkness while unpacking etc. Not a good way to start a vacation after a 14 hour flight.The other problem we encountered was small, but became VERY annoying. The wood floors creaked very very loud in some areas when steping on them. If I went to the bathroom at night and stepped on that spot, my wife would wake up startled! So had to tippie toe and avoid those areas.The electricity in the entire room only works when you put your room key in a slot as you enter. So if you want a light during the night time hours, you have to leave the entire room light! Can't pick and choose which lights to keep on or off. The thing that bothered and annoyned me the most was about my room rate. Apparently, Le Meridian changed their tax structure starting September 1st. They told me that due to this, I have to pay an additional $210 US for the night of 9/1. I fought this very strongly and said that Expedia did not have this charge listed, and if there was miscommunication between Le Meridian and Expedia, that I would not be responsible for it. I was then contacted about this matter THREE TIMES! I then got Expedia on the phone, told them the situation, and the manager at Expedia spoke to Le Meridian, and they agreed that I would not be charged any extra.What was funny thought, when we were checking out, I overheard them doing the same thing to every other guest! And EVERY one of the guests refused to pay. Should be an interesting month for them...The last thing that irked me about this place was the front desk staff. They are CLUELESS as to the on goings of their OWN hotel! I called and asked the hours of a restraurant, and was told they open at 12 noon. I waited for an hour for it to open, only to find out it really opens at 12:30! On a sunday I asked if the shops on the second floor were open, and was told no, all shops are closed on Sunday. But lo and behold! ALL of them were open! At one point my wife and I were in the mood of a certain Indian dish, and we were told that coffee shop had it (which confused me). When we proceeded to the coffee shop, all we saw were cakes and pastries. When I asked them, I got a strange look and the obvious answer.So...if you need to find anything out, DO NOT ask the front desk, call the restaurant/store directly! Overall....I had heard great things about this hotel, but after this past week, I feel that it is VERY overrated. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was nice, but the customer service was NILL!! I would recommend to stay at the Muria Sheraton or Taj instead.	
Aug 15 2007	Nice hotel	We stayed 2 nights at the beginning of our Rajahstan tour and one night at the end of it. First two nights were in a suite, still not renovated but fine anyway. The only problem was with the A/C just above our bed with the following dilemma : keeping it open and freezing or shutting it off and boiling ... surprising for a 5* hotel ! Nice view on Delhi but could have been better if the windows had been washed. We spent the last night in a renovated room (A/C at the entry of the room, so problem fixed ...). Nice design with a blue or yellow light wall behind the bed. The only problem was that our room was just next the rooms being currently in the process to be renovated ... so forget about relaxing till 6 pm. Staff not particularily smiling.	
Jun 17 2007 	Good hotel in central New Delhi	We have just returned from 8 days at Le Meridien New Delhi. Apparently ther hotel has quite recently been taken over by Meridien and is still undergoing some refurbishment.We booked a Royal Club room which included 2 way airport transfers. We were met at the airport and promptly driven to the hotel.The driver was charming and offered us bottles of water as well as a commentary as we approached central delhi. On arrival at the hotel we were checked in very quickly and courteously at the royal club desk and taken straight to our room.The room was not the biggest we have stayed in but it was very nicely furnished with mood lighting,plasma tv and mini bar( soft drinks and just one bottle of kingfisher beer).There was a bottle of wine and a bowl of fruit in the room on arrival( the fruit wasnt changed though which meant we had to throw out the apples we didnt eat after 4 days......in other meridien hotels fruit has been changed daily if not eaten).The room was serviced twice daily and even the bathrobes( which were very skimpy) were changed daily.The club lounge was very comfortable but a little dark as it had no windows being in the centre of the hotel. Breakfast was excellent and served from 7am until 10am ( 11am on sundays).High tea was served between 3pm and 5pm...this consisted of a selection of hot and cold snacks which were different everyday.Unfortunately, i made the mistake of eating a canape with mayonnaise on the day before we left and subsequently developed a severe case of ' delhi belly' which made me very ill, so beware.Between 6pm and 8pm alcohol was served and also more snacks, either vegetarian or non vegetarian. They were delicious and changed each evening.The club lounge staff were all very charming though one or two were sometimes more interested in watching cricket or surfing the internet than serving.Our only real complaint was that the lounge was often busy with very loud business people conducting business. We appreciated this was a business hotel but the lounge is provided for club guests as a place of comfort away from the main hotel. The last thing we wanted were loud business people in there conducting their meetings on the phone or in person.We ate in La Brassiere restaurant a few times....this was very good and very reasonable. Henri's bar was also a pleasant spot for a drink with great views from the 20th floor.However, this was also closed for 2 days due to meetings being held there.The pool area is located on the 4th floor. This was very disappointing.The biggest problem was that the concrete surrounding the pool was covered in bird droppings and there were at least 20 pigeons bathing and drinking from the pool when we decided to go down for some sun and a swim. Needless to say we didnt venture in.We did mention this to one of the sales and marketing team who came to speak to us one evening in the club lounge. He explained that the pool area had not yet been refurbished........this is no reason for not keeping it clean!The hotel was well situated for Connaught place and all the sights in New and Old Delhi. There are auotrickshaws and taxis in abundance but they will all try to ' rip you off '. One rickshaw driver even told us it is the norm to overcharge tourists.We hired a car and driver via Expedia and this was definitely the best way to see Delhi.I would recommend staying at this hotel as the location is good as long as you are not expecting the same standards as say Dubai, London or Bangkok.Just a few other things.........in addition to your room rate and the 12.5% luxury tax you will also be charged another 5% on 12.5% of the room rate.( at least i think thats what it meant on the bill)...we couldnt quite figure out why and to be honest i was so ill as we departed we could even be bothered to ask.Also, you will be charged tax on all your food and your drinks so the base price on the menu is not the price you will pay,. This can be quite a shock if you arent prepared for it. Fortunately we were.	
Jun 13 2007 	Surprisingly nice.......	When a business partner suggested we stay at Le Meridien for 2 nights last week, I was not that thrilled. I have never stayed there but having lived in Delhi in the late 90s, I had frequented their public areas and restaurants and had not been impressed. My first surprise was to see that the Le Meridien group is now part of Starwood Hotels. As a Starwood Preferred Guest, I was ushered to a special desk and checked in quickly. The room was the next surprise. In place of the usual carpet that retains the flavours - pleasant and unpleasant - of the previous six guests, there was a wooden floor. LCD TV on the wall, very nice appointments all round and an extremely pleasant bathroom with a shower mounted directly overhead as well as a &quot;telephone&quot; type shower. Climate control was excellent and could be carried out from a bedside console. Breakfast was varied and extensive and a very nice light supper before departing for the airport rounded off my stay. I had asked for late checkout till 8 pm. Again, I was most pleasantly surprised to be told that there would be no charge if I stayed till 6 pm (most generous) and half day charge till 8 pm. I readily accepted as it allowed for a shower and change of clothes before heading for the airport. The one downside of my stay was checkout - the clerk handling it made several mistakes and was slow. Coupled with its great location, I would return to Le Meridien, New Delhi the next time.	
May 30 2007	Fantastic hotel	We stayed here for 9 nights in a Le Club room. The hotel is amazing, very clean, modern and in a pretty good location (10 minute stroll to Connaught place). The staff are very attentive and when we did have a small problem we were seen by a hotel director who did absolutely everything and more to keep us happy. Surely the sign of a good hotel is how well they rectify problems... the Le Med were 100% brilliant.We ate in the hotel restaurants a couple of times following late arrivals from trips and found the food to be varied, very well cooked and presented and not to pricey...certainly compared to European prices.The pool area was a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of City life and enjoys stunning views. Beds and towels are provided.The rooms are well sized and ours had mood lighting, a large wall mounted plasma t.v, mini bar, climate control, safe and a super bathroom with waterfall shower.All in all we can thouroughly recommend this hotel and it rates as one of the best we have stayed in ( and we've stayed in hundreds!!!!)	
Apr 5 2007 	Bad Decor Great Location	After a less than satisfying stay at the Hotel Nikko, I decided to end my trip to India in a more conveniently located hotel. The Le Meridien was perfect. It was very easy to walk to Connaught Pl, the Cottage Industries, the Presidential Residence, and the Central Museum. Plus, while there were a few beggars and hawkers (as must be expected), they were not overwhelming. I felt very safe.The hotel itself had very large rooms and the breakfast I had was decent. Also, I ate in the Indian restaurant and enjoyed it. My only beef with the joint is that the decor is weird and alienating. Too weirdly modern. Still, I would stay there again.	
Mar 14 2007	Better than expected	Having read all the negative reviews, I was prepared to be disappointed but, in fact, the Meridien was a very nice hotel. The rooms were large and well appointed, the restaurants in the hotel were good and the location was excellent. Particularly liked the excellent showers and the plasma screen tvs. Didn't much care for the mood lighting but that is a small point. I would recommend the Meridien to anyone going to Delhi.	
Jan 26 2007	5* luxury!	After completing a tour of India we spent our last night at this hotel. It was great to have a comfortable bed, a hot power shower and good quality food. The hotel has the usual Meridien corporate fixtures and fittings which you can see in any Meridien hotel the world over! But after spending some time touring India this was the perfect hotel to relax in before flying back to the UK!The hotel is also in an excellent location in New Delhi, close to major sites.	
Jan 23 2007	Really nice!	I am surprised at some of the comments that have been left. Yes the Merdian is a bit pricey but the hotel is really nice and the rooms were clean. The service was excellent. The buffet breakfast that is included in your stay is really great! A lot to choose from. The staff is extremely helpful and it is buzzing with people all the time. It is walking minutes from the central shopping areas. I stayed for 5 days and loved it. It was a comfortable stay indeed!	
Dec 14 2006 	It was OK for a one night stay	I feel compelled to write a review simply because I stayed here for one night in November 2006 despite some of the recent negative reviews. I'm not a particularly fussy traveller and didn't have high expectations for this hotel based on the reviews.Was met by a hotel driver at Delhi airport. He did try to persuade me to go shopping before I got to the hotel, but a simple &quot;no thank you&quot; was enough. He was polite and very talkative.Selected a Club level room. The room was fine - nothing particularly special but comfortable and certainly large enough. Bathroom was unappealing but enjoyed the rain shower. Toiletries were standard. My main gripe was that I could hear loud music in the room until quite late when I was trying to get some much needed sleep. The Club breakfast was fine, with very good service. I'm not a picky eater so I found enough there for a filling breakfast.I found the staff overall to be quite pleasant. The lobby wasn't really to my taste and I think overall the hotel lacked a certain atmosphere. It wasn't a luxury retreat from the hustle and bustle of Delhi although I wasn't really expecting this.I have to say that this hotel is quite unremarkable and given the price it was poor value for money. However, it served its purpose for one night. The best thing I could say is that it's not as bad as some of the previous reviews suggest. I wouldn't return here even though there was nothing particularly bad about this hotel. I stayed here due to a Starwood promotion otherwise I can think of better options in Delhi for around the same price.	
Dec 1 2006	Excellent hotel	Brilliant hotel, modern with first class facilities. Staff very friendly and helpful. Great rooms and fabulous food. The spa area was particularly good - would highly recommend this hotel	
Oct 4 2006 	First the good news	Ive been stewing about this hotel since my last stay in November of 2005.Ill start by saying that Ive stayed at the Le Meridien New Delhi twice now and overall was happy with my stays. The rooms are very nice if just a bit cold in a post modern way. I stayed on the club floor and I like the beds, bathroom and the nice mood light thing at the head of the bed.The lobby restaurant was good as far as lobby restaurants go and the Chinese restaurant was outstanding. The snacks in the club lounge are nothing special but the service was very friendly and good as was most of the other staff at the hotel. Here is the big but. On departure from the hotel a hotel car took me to the airport with a uniformed Le Meridien driver. Before we were down the driveway he (not so subtlety) started hitting me up for money. Im no stranger to 3rd world countries having traveled to them routinely for the last 25 years but when he took a detour down a dark street to show me his horrible apartment I got really concerned. After I refused to get out of the car he finally relented and took me on to the airport. Once there I handed him a sizeable tip (happy to be getting away) but it was apparently not enough so he followed me right up to the terminal doors starched white suit and all.I sent Le Meridien e-mails about this incident but I never got a reply. I will be in Delhi again next month but this time at the Taj.	
Oct 1 2006 	Dissappointing	We had booked two rooms at this hotel for four nights. We were overcharged for the rooms from the rate quoted at the time of booking.Then later on the charged us more stating that the rate given at the time of checking in was for single occupancy and there were two of us stating in the room.Well when four people are standing in front of you it is amply clear that there are going to be two people staying the room!The breakfast is nothing to talk about, and i can say the same about food there in general.This hotel is a text book case of how you can't make a hotel good by having just a good location, modern rooms and newly renovated lobby. The people who manage is what makes the great.Overall the attituted of the staff was of being uninterested to down right ignorant and arrogant.	
Sep 29 2006	Average	Nice hotel. However, for USD300/night for a club room, it is not very value for money. The brekkie on the club floor is not much to crow about. The room is quite nice though, although the design is a tad too modern for my liking. The flooring could have been carpeted for better effect.	
Sep 23 2006 	Worst Le meridian Ive stayed at.	Depressing, gloomy, and dirty. We stayed there for 3 nights and it was just awful. I wouldnt stay there ever again, and to be honest I dont think Ill ever go to Delhi ever again either.	
Aug 18 2006 	Worst Value in Delhi	Where to begin? I booked a $170 club level, non-smoking room. When I arrived, I was informed that there were no non-smoking club level rooms available. So I was placed in a regular room ... at the club level price. No negotiation.Then there was the construction. Currently, the hotel is undergoing renovation, and construction lasts until 9 or 9:30 depending upon who you ask. Regardless, if you like listening to drill and hammers until 9:30 at night, this is the hotel for you. When I complained, the staff offered to move me to a room that is out of earshot of the construction. When I complained to the duty manager, then the manager, I received no reply. Customer comfort is not important to the staff here.Finally, I was appalled to find the the hotel gym is smaller than my room. Three running machines, an exercise bike, and a weight set. That's it. Oh, and the pool was closed.STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE! I have visited 29 countries, and this is the worst so-called &quot;luxury hotel&quot; experience that I have ever had. THE WORST.	
Jul 9 2006	Freezing!	We were booked into stay at one of the 2 bedroom suites - my brother, his wife, my wife and I - for USD750per night (brekkie included) it was extremely average - huge! but straight out of the 80's. Was also cold!! - no heating. When I asked reception and the hotel manager they claimed that none of the 5 star hotels in New Delhi were centrally heated - I found this very surprising! In any case after complaining about how disappointed we were they moved us to the recently renovated wing in the hotel but into two separate suites - very nice club suites indeed - plasma screens, polished floorboards, sep lounge, huge bathroom. But again no heating! - but for some reason the rooms seemed warmer - I figured probably because they were on the side of the hotel that got the sun! - they did give us a couple of small electric heaters!The bathroom - first shower my wife had the drain got clogged and I had to call maintenance!Overall - quite disappointed given what we were paying!!	
Jun 14 2006	a little stark but very nice	spent two nights in Le Mer, New Delhi, then away for five days and back for two more nights. Lobby is very stark, simplistic, New Age. rooms are spartan, but nice: hardwood floors, shimmery tile in baths, sparse furniture, good electronic outputs/inputs (42 inch flat screen TV for World Cup games !!) breakfast buffet (in fact all meals in 24-hour coffee shop) was very nice. a little NON-western....where's my crisp bacon ? ... but excellent service and variety. staff was superb. had a burnt out light bulb....called downstairs, replaced in 10 minutes.	
Apr 30 2006	Excellent hotel!	This is a modern, comfortable large hotel. It is very well situated. The lobby is huge, very contemporary, always busy. The rooms are very well designed, with all the mod cons. The service is excellent. The breakfast is fine - not amazing.The Indian restaurant is absolutely brilliant. Much, much better than the ridiculously touristic, over priced, hugely over rated Sehraton's Bukhara. And much cheaper, too!We loved the light wooden floors, the comfy slippers, the central control console next to the bed, the large plasma TV and the well equipped mini bar. There is no bath yub, just a shower, but a very nice one! One complaint would be, that it ws not possible to change the room temperature, which, albeit airconditioned, was not as cool as we like it. Having said that - it was quite pleasant. Thr Business Club is nicely done but too dark for our liking. Some more lights there would be nice.If you like character and old world feel, and price is no issue, choose the Oriental. If you like contemporary &quot;business like&quot; hotel - choose Le Meridien.
